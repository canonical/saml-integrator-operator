# Getting started

In this tutorial, we'll walk you through the process of deploying the SAML Integrator charm.

## Requirements

You will need:

* A laptop or desktop running Ubuntu (or you can use a VM).
* [Juju and Microk8s](https://juju.is/docs/olm/microk8s) installed.

## Deploy this charm

The charm will the deployed in a new model named `saml`:

```
# Add the model
juju add-model saml

# Deploy the charm
juju deploy saml-integrator

# Provide the mandatory configurations
juju config saml-integrator metadata_url=https://login.staging.ubuntu.com/saml/metadata
juju config saml-integrator entity_id=https://login.staging.ubuntu.com

```

By running `juju status --relations` the current state of the deployment can be queried, with the charm eventually reaching `Active` state:
```
Model  Controller          Cloud/Region        Version  SLA          Timestamp
saml   microk8s-localhost  microk8s/localhost  2.9.44   unsupported  12:54:25+02:00

Unit                Workload  Agent  Address     Ports  Message

```

Run `kubectl get pods -n saml` to see the pods that are being created by the charms:
```
NAME                            READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
modeloperator-d465f6695-zvhk8   1/1     Running   0          2m33s
saml-integrator-0               1/1     Running   0          99s

```
