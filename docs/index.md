A [Juju](https://juju.is/) [charm](https://juju.is/docs/olm/charmed-operators) deploying and managing a SAML Integrator on Kubernetes. SAML is an XML-based open-standard for transferring identity data between two parties: an identity provider (IdP) and a service provider (SP). This charm simplifies configuration of SAML SPs by providing a single point of configuration for all the requirers using the same SAML entity. It can be deployed on many different Kubernetes platforms, from [MicroK8s](https://microk8s.io) to [Charmed Kubernetes](https://ubuntu.com/kubernetes) and public cloud Kubernetes offerings. As such, the charm makes it easy to manage and propagate SAML configuration, while giving the freedom to deploy on the Kubernetes platform of their choice. For DevOps or SRE teams this charm will make operating any charm leveraging SAML authentication simple and straightforward through Juju's clean interface.
